Imagine a 3x3 grid. Each cell in this grid is initially empty.
We can represent this grid using a JavaScript array with 9 elements. 
Each element will initially hold a null value.


let board = [null, null, null,
            null, null, null,
            null, null, null];


There are two players: X and O. We'll keep track of whose turn it is using a variable.
Initially, player X starts.
After each move, we switch the player.



When a player clicks on an empty cell, we:
Check if the cell is empty (contains null).
If empty, we update the corresponding element in the board array with the player's symbol (X or O).
Update the cell's display to show the symbol.




Checking for a Win
After each move, we need to check if the current player has won.

There are 8 possible winning combinations (3 rows, 3 columns, 2 diagonals).
For each combination, check if all three cells contain the same symbol (X or O).
If any combination matches, the current player wins.



Checking for a Draw
If the board is full (no empty cells) and there's no winner, the game is a draw.
